# Dotfiles
Created by [Kewbish](https://github.com/kewbish).  

Things that work for me might not work for you, but feel free to use these anywhere or to use them as a basis for creating your own dotfiles. I have a very monochrome aesthetic and prefer keyboard-driven tools, which might explain some of my configuration options.
