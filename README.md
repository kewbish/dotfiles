# Dotfiles
Created by [Kewbish](https://github.com/kewbish).  

Things that work for me might not work for you, but feel free to use these anywhere or to use them as a basis for creating your own dotfiles. I will *attempt* to document them at a later date, but for now they're pretty self-explanatory if you Google enough.
